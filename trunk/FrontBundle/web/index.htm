Introduction
</h3>

<p>
This is the seach interface for the Peer to Peer Information Retrieval system.
The project is built on the Gnutella protocol and relies on an index created by
apache Lucene to make indexed searches over a peer to peer network. Searches can 
be performed from the search box found above and using Direct Web Remoting (DWR) 
results are returned continuously as they arrive. 
</p>

<h3>
Setting up the Index
</h3>

<p>
The index is set up automatically the first time the project is run. It will index
any files that are currently in the directory to index folder. In order to modify the
index simply add, remove or modify the files in this folder and the index will be updated
automatically. 
</p>

<h3>
How To
</h3>

<p> 
In order to perform searches using this project enter the term you wish to search 
for in the search box above. The search box will accept any alpha-numeric combination 
as well special characters. The search that is performed will return a link to any 
file that has the search term anywhere in its body. In addition it will return a link 
to any files that contain the search word in their ID3 tags; tags used to catagorize 
music files. Once a result is found clicking on the link will download the file. 
</p> 

<h3>
